# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. It is a very simple static website with some basic information. I set  this up rather easily and quick by tweaking an [HTPL5 UP template](#html5-up).




## [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/)
If you need a simple static website for something this template collection could be useful. I based my website on the [Solid state template](https://html5up.net/solid-state).

### Template readme
The template itself contained a [readme](./README_template.txt) which could be nice to read.
